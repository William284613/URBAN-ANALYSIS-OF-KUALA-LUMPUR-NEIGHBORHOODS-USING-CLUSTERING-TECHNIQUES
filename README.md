The analysis offers thorough insights into neighborhood features, assisting people to relocate within the city with knowledge. 
The project uses K-means clustering to classify neighborhoods into discrete groups by integrating Foursquare's venue and real estate da-tasets.
Areas with comparable property values, sizes, and types, as well as close-by facilities like eateries, parks, and schools, are represented by each cluster. 
Folium visualizations improve how clustering results are interpreted by providing interactive maps that allow for easy exploration of neighbor-hood features. 
The study highlights Kuala Lumpur's dynamic appeal.
It ac-commodates a range of lifestyles and preferences by showcasing the city's diverse urban landscape, which includes residential communities, cultural hubs, and business-centric districts. 
This method helps prospective movers make decisions more easily and adds to the understanding of urban planning to improve the quality of life for residents and promote sustainable devel-opment.
